This was cloned from a Code Lab tutorial https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/

The tutorial uses Yahoo API to create a weather app, but unfortunately the Yahoo retired the API in Jan 2019. In order to still learn from this tutorial, I have imitated the API with the help of [My JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/) by [typicode](https://github.com/typicode). This is an awesome tool to help hobbyist develop faster. If you like it, please support the creator on Patreon.

# Your first Progressive Web App Code Lab

These are the resource files needed for the [Your first Progressive Web App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/)

## What you’ll learn
* How to design and construct an app using the “app shell” method
* How to make your app work offline
* How to store data for use offline later

## What you’ll need

* [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb), or use your own web server of choice.
